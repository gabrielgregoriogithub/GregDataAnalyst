            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
                I am a Electrical Engineering but my professional experiences gradually guided me to areas of data manipulation and statistics thats why I am also a in Data Science and Big Data Specialist. I consider myself a professional highly guided by innovations, a characteristic that was accentuated throughout my academic and professional life due to the great diversity of experiences that I had the opportunity to experience between management, sales, education, marketing and finance. I have sought to delve deeper into data analysis studies and extract value from historical commercial information from different business areas to constantly develop insights for improvement wherever I operate. I found that I adapt better to work environments that are constantly challenging and dynamic, provide an intense learning curve and have a meaningful purpose. I can (and usually do) work well on my own, but I am at my best collaborating with others.
